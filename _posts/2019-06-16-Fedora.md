## Preperation

- Acquire a [Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/) image.
- Create a bootable USB with that image.
- Open a terminal and acquire root.
- Disable enforcing selinux with `setenforce 0`, this is only required for setting the password for the new user that you'll create.
- Acquire the `genfstab` script which makes it easier to create the `/etc/fstab`. The script is originally from [Arch Install Scripts](https://git.archlinux.org/arch-install-scripts.git), but for convenience you can acquire it and add executable permission with this command:  
  `wget https://github.com/glacion/genfstab/releases/download/1.0/genfstab; chmod +x genfstab`

## Partitioning

If you are not familiar with partitioning, [get comfortable with it](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning).  
For reference, these are the partitions i use for testing in a VM with a drive of 12GiB:

- `/dev/sda1` ESP partition of size 100MiB, mounted on `/boot`.
- `/dev/sda2` swap partition of size 1.9GiB.
- `/dev/sda3` XFS partition of size 10GiB, mounted on `/`.

I chose `/mnt` to be my install root, you may change to your preference but be sure to update the commands accordingly.

## Installing The Base System

Assuming that your partitions are mounted on `/mnt`, install the base system like below:

```bash
dnf install \
--installroot=/mnt \
--releasever=30 \
--setopt=install_weak_deps=False \
--setopt=keepcache=True \
--assumeyes \
--nodocs \
systemd dnf glibc-langpack-en passwd rtkit policycoreutils \
NetworkManager audit firewalld selinux-policy-targeted kbd zchunk sudo \
vim-minimal systemd-udev rootfiles less iputils deltarpm xfsprogs sqlite lz4
```

- `releasever=30` Install fedora 30, change if desired.
- `setopt=install_weak_deps=False` Do not install weak dependencies.
- `glibc-langpack-en` English langpack for glibc, in order to have a localized system install `glibc-langpack-<LANGCODE>` if no langpack is specified to install, dnf will install `glibc-all-langpacks` package which costs 100MB alone compared to installing them seperately which costs around 1MB per langpack. Use a different langcode if you want to use a different locale.
- `sqlite` is helpful for `dnf` completions.
- `xfsprogs` because i used an XFS root, change or add more filesystem tools depending on your setup.
- `lz4` will be used for compressing the initramfs, change if you are using a different compression method.

## Configuration

- Setup machine id and configure the system locale, keymap, timezone, hostname on your new system;

  ```bash
  systemd-firstboot \
  --root=/mnt \
  --locale=C.UTF-8 \
  --keymap=us \
  --hostname=fedora \
  --setup-machine-id
  ```

- Generate fstab and save it in your new system, replace `-U` with `-L` if you want to use labels instead of UUIDs in your `/etc/fstab`

  ```bash
  ./genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
  ```

- Chroot without booting and add an user

  ```bash
  systemd-nspawn -D /mnt
  useradd -c "<YOUR_FULL_NAME>" -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/bash <YOUR_USERNAME>
  passwd <YOUR_USERNAME>
  exit
  ```

- Boot the system as a container

  ```bash
  systemd-nspawn -bD /mnt
  ```

  Login with the newly created user and get root with `sudo -s`, commands until the `exit` will be executed in the container.

- DNF configuration

  - Delete unnecessary repositories with `rm -f /mnt/etc/yum.repos.d/*{*cisco*,*testing*,*modular*}*`

  - Add following options to `/etc/dnf/dnf.conf`

    ```ini
    install_weak_deps=False
    keepcache=True
    tsflags=nodocs
    ```

- Install the bootloader

  `systemd-boot` is a fairly minimal and gets the job done without much configuration. If you opt to use `GRUB` or something similar, you are on your own.

  ```bash
  bootctl install
  ```

- Add any required filesystem to `dracut` configuration

  Dracut needs to know the root filesystem so that it can mount it when booting, it doesn't need to know about other filesystems that are in the system. Open `/etc/dracut.conf.d/fs.conf` and add the root filesystem like below:

  ```python
  filesystems+="xfs"
  ```

- Install the kernel

  ```bash
  dnf install kernel
  ```

- Configure the bootloader

  When you installed the kernel, the bootloader created an entry at `/boot/loader/entries/<MACHINE_ID>-<KVER>.conf`, however it just copied the boot parameters of the live system.

  The `options` part of the file shows something like this:

  ```text
  options    BOOT_IMAGE=/images/pxeboot/vmlinuz
  root=live:CDLABEL=Fedora-WS-Live-30-1-2 rd.live.image quiet
  ```

  Change it to something like this:

  ```text
  options    root=UUID=<UUID_OF_ROOT_PARTITION> ro quiet
  ```

  Add the kernel parameters that you want to include here.

- Exit the container with `poweroff`

- EFI Entry

  Create an EFI entry using `efibootmgr` like below.  
  **Note:** Make sure that the -d and -p arguments point to the ESP of your system.

  ```bash
  efibootmgr -d /dev/sda \
  -p 1 \
  -c \
  -L "Fedora" \
  -l /EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi
  ```

- Clean up and reboot

  ```bash
  umount -R /mnt
  reboot
  ```

## Tweaks

- Dracut  
  
  - Install binutils with `dnf install binutils` so that initramfs can be stripped.

  - Open `/etc/dracut.conf.d/custom.conf` and add the lines below:

     ```python
     drivers+="i915"
     compress="lz4"
     hostonly="yes"
     ```

    - `drivers+="i915"` add i915 driver to initramfs for early Kernel Mode Setting.
    - `compress="lz4"` use lz4 for the initramfs compression.
    - `hostonly="yes"` generate images that works with this host only.

  - Rebuild the initramfs with `dracut -fv`

- Time

  - Set the timezone with `timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Istanbul`
  - Enable NTP with `timedatectl set-ntp true`
