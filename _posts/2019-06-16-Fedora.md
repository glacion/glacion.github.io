title: Minimal Fedora Installation Via Chroot
---

Installing Fedora from the installer can... Get complicated, or the outcome may not satisfy you.  
So in order to achieve greater freedom, a smaller installation or the experience, i prefer to install Fedora like i would install Arch Linux.  
Though you _can_ do a default install first and _then_ trim the installation, it can get more time consuming.  
**NOTE:** This is how i install Fedora on my ASUS X550VX laptop, that's why everything here may not be beneficial to you.  
So, let's get started.

## Preperation

- Acquire a [Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/) image.
- Create a bootable USB with that image.
- Get comfortable with the live system: Set keyboard layout, connect to internet etc.
- Open a terminal and acquire root.
- Disable enforcing selinux with `setenforce 0`, this is only required for setting the password for the new user that you'll create.
- Acquire the `genfstab` script which makes it easier to create the `/etc/fstab`. The script is originally from [Arch Install Scripts](https://git.archlinux.org/arch-install-scripts.git), but for convenience you can acquire it and add executable permission with this command `wget https://github.com/glacion/genfstab/releases/download/1.0/genfstab; chmod +x genfstab`

## Partitioning

**NOTE:** This is not different from a standard EFI partitioning scheme; so if you're familiar with this, you may skip ahead, the source of errors that may be caused by selecting a different filesystem will be pointed out later on.

In order to keep this as simple as possible, here we will have 3 partitions, and assume the drive is called `/dev/sda`:

- `/` as `xfs`
- Since this is an UEFI installation, the EFI System Partition will be formatted as `vfat` and mounted on `/boot`
- And a `swap`

### Creating the partitions with `cgdisk`

Run `cgdisk /dev/sda` and create the partitions below, select `[New]` for each partition:

    #ESP
    First Sector: Leave This Blank
    Size in sectors: 512M
    Hex Code: EF00
    Enter new partition name: ESP

    #Swap
    First Sector: Leave This Blank
    Size in sectors: 2G
    Hex Code: 8200
    Enter new partition name: swap

    #Root
    First Sector: Leave This Blank
    Size in sectors: Leave This Blank
    Hex Code: Leave This Blank
    Enter new partition name: fedora

The end result should look like this:

### Creating the filesystems

- ESP (EFI System Partition)

  Create a `FAT32` filesystem on `/dev/sda1` with the label `ESP`.

      mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1 -n ESP

- Swap Partition

  Create swap on `/dev/sda2` with label `swap`.

      mkswap /dev/sda2 -L swap

- Root Partition

  Create an `xfs` filesystem on `/dev/sda3` with label `fedora`.

      mkfs.xfs /dev/sda3 -L fedora

### Mounting the filesystems

- Mount our root partition on /mnt.

      mount /dev/sda3 /mnt

- Let the system know that swap will be here.

      swapon /dev/sda2

- Create the mountpoint for our ESP and mount the ESP.

      mkdir /mnt/boot
      mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot

## Installing The Base System

After we are done partitioning; we can finally install the base system onto our new partitions.

    dnf install \
    --installroot=/mnt \
    --releasever=30 \
    --setopt=install_weak_deps=False \
    --nodocs \
    glibc-langpack-en rtkit file NetworkManager audit \
    dnf dnf-plugins-core firewalld iproute policycoreutils \
    rpm selinux-policy-targeted shadow-utils sudo vim-minimal \
    hostname iputils less passwd procps-ng deltarpm kbd NetworkManager{,-{openvpn,wifi}} xfsprogs lz4

Confirm the prompts when asked.

- `--installroot=/mnt` treat `/mnt` as the installation root.
- `--releasever=30` use Fedora 30 as target release, use `rawhide` if you want a 'rolling release' Fedora.
- `--setopt=install_weak_deps=False` don't install weak dependencies(`--no-install-recommends` on Debian), more info about these switches can be found [here](https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conf_ref.html)
- `--nodocs` Do not install documentation.
- `glibc-langpack-en` English langpack for glibc, in order to have a localized system install `glibc-langpack-<LANGCODE>` if no langpack is specified to install, dnf will install `glibc-all-langpacks` package which costs a whopping 100MB alone compared to installing them seperately which costs around 1MB per langpack. Use a different langcode if you want to use a different locale.
- `xfsprogs` is necessary since we are on a `xfs` root.
- `lz4` will be used for compressing the initramfs.
- Other packages are selected from the `Core` group, the other packages in that group will either be installed later or won't be required.

## Configuration

- Setup machine id and configure the system locale, keymap, timezone, hostname on your new system;

      systemd-firstboot \
      --root=/mnt \
      --locale=en_US.UTF-8 \
      --keymap=us \
      --timezone=Europe/Istanbul \
      --hostname=fedora \
      --setup-machine-id

- Generate fstab and save it in your new system, replace `-U` with `-L` if you want to use labels instead of UUIDs in your `/etc/fstab`

      ./genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

- Chroot without booting and add an user

      systemd-nspawn -D /mnt
      useradd -c "<YOUR_FULL_NAME>" -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/bash <YOUR_USERNAME>
      passwd <YOUR_USERNAME>
      exit

- Boot the system as a container

      systemd-nspawn -bD /mnt

  Login with the newly created user, commands until the `exit` will be executed in the container.

- Install the bootloader

  I'll be using the `systemd-boot` as it is fairly minimal and gets the job done without much configuration. If you opt to use `GRUB`, you are on your own.

      bootctl install

- Add `dracut` configuration

  Dracut is the tool for creating initramfs files on Fedora, Customizing its configuration is required since we have a `xfs` root and dracut needs to know that.  
  Open `/etc/dracut.conf.d/custom.conf` with your favorite editor.

      filesystems+="xfs"
      drivers+="i915"
      compress="lz4"
      hostonly="yes"

  **NOTE:** If you installed with a different filesystem, you need to change the `filesystems` entry accordingly.

- Installing the kernel

  The base installation didn't include a kernel, so we'll install it now.

      dnf install kernel

- Configuring the bootloader

  When we installed the kernel, the bootloader created an entry at `/boot/loader/entries/<MACHINE_ID>-<KVER>.conf`, however it just copied the boot parameters of the live system.  
  So in order for the bootloader to not fail, we'll fix the configuration now.  
  The `options` part of the file shows something like this:

      options    BOOT_IMAGE=/images/pxeboot/vmlinuz root=live:CDLABEL=Fedora-WS-Live-28-1-1 rd.live.image quiet

  Change it to somthing like this:

      options    root=UUID=<UUID_OF_/> ro rhgb quiet acpi_osi=! acpi_osi="Windows 2009"

  The UUID of the root drive can be reached with `blkid` command.
  Add the kernel parameters that you want to include here.
  The acpi_osi parameters are required for my laptop to not hang in graphical session.

- SELinux

  The newly installed system will fail most of its capabilities as SELinux labels are broken after the initial installation. Issuing `fixfiles -F onboot` will cause the system to relabel on the next boot.

- Clean up and reboot

      poweroff # Because the container was booted
      umount -R /mnt
      reboot

## Post Install

### DNF configuration

In order to persist the `--setopt` parameter that was used before, append `install_weak_deps=False` to `/etc/dnf/dnf.conf`;
in order to persist the `--nodocs` parameter, append `tsflags=nodocs` as well.

### RPMFusion

Installing RPMFusion free repository is as easy as:

    dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

If you need to install nonfree repository, it is almost the same:

    dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

### Minimal KDE Installation

A minimalistic KDE installation with some common utilities can be achieved by installing these packages:

    ark # Archive manager
